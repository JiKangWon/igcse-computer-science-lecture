                <h3>1.3. Application Example: Self-Parking Cars</h3>
                <p>Self-parking cars use on-board sensors and cameras to gauge parking spaces. The sensors transmit signals that bounce off objects, and the computer uses the return time to calculate the object's position, creating a 3D image. Actuators operate the steering rack, brakes, and throttle under the full control of the computer to complete the maneuver.</p>

                <h2>III. MAIN CONTENT (2/3): ROBOTICS</h2>

                <h3>2.1. Definition</h3>
                <p><strong>Robotics</strong> is a branch of (computer) science that combines the design, construction, and operation of robots. A <strong>robot</strong> is defined as a mechanical device that is capable of carrying out tasks that are normally done by humans.</p>

                <h3>2.2. Characteristics of a Robot</h3>
                <p>To be defined as a robot, the device must have three characteristics:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Ability to sense their surroundings:</strong> Achieved using sensors (light, pressure, temperature, etc.) to recognize the environment.</li>
                    <li><strong>A degree of movement:</strong> They are mechanical structures (wheels, motors, actuators) that can perform functions like turning, gripping, or lifting, often using end-effectors (attachments).</li>
                    <li><strong>Programmable:</strong> They contain a controller (a "brain," typically a microprocessor) that determines action based on sensor data.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Many robots do not possess AI because they typically perform repetitive tasks.</p>

                <h3>2.3. Classification of Physical Robots</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Independent (Autonomous) Robots:</strong> Have no direct human control and can totally replace human activity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dependent Robots:</strong> Require a human interface and supplement, rather than totally replace, human activity.</li>
                </ul>

                            <li>Can lead to higher unemployment among manual labour workers.</li>
                            <li>There is a risk of deskilling when robots take over specialized tasks.</li>

                <h3>3.1. Definition and Characteristics</h3>
                <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> is a branch of computer science dedicated to the simulation of intelligent human behaviour by a computer. This involves replicating cognitive functions—the mental process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the five senses.</p>
                <p>AI is a collection of rules and data, combined with the ability to reason, learn, and adapt to external stimuli.</p>
                <p>AI can be categorized by performance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Narrow AI:</strong> Superior performance to a human when performing one specific task.</li>
                    <li><strong>General AI:</strong> Performance is similar (not superior) to a human performing a specific task.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strong AI:</strong> Superior performance to a human across many tasks.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Expert systems</strong> are a form of AI developed to mimic the decision-making ability of a human expert. They use knowledge and inference to solve problems.</p>

                <h3>3.3. Machine Learning (ML)</h3>
                <p><strong>Machine learning</strong> is a sub-set of AI in which algorithms are 'trained' and learn from their past experiences and examples. This allows machines to make decisions or predictions without being specifically programmed for new data.</p>
